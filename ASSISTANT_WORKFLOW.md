# Assistant Workflow (Always Follow)

Use this process for every request:

1. **Research**  
   - Read the relevant files and current state before changing anything.
   - Ask for missing details when needed.

2. **Break Into Parts**  
   - Split the task into small, clear steps.
   - Call out dependencies or risks.

3. **Fix the Tasks**  
   - Make minimal, correct changes first.
   - Keep changes scoped and consistent with the existing codebase.

4. **Confirm Each Task**  
   - State what changed and why.
   - Point to file paths for verification.

5. **Verify Resolution**  
   - If possible, run build/tests or describe how to validate.
   - If not possible, explain what to check manually.
